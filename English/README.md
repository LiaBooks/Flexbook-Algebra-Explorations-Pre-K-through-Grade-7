### 1.1 Introduction

<article>

This algebra module has been designed to introduce Pre-kindergarten students to basic concepts of algebra and to enhance their problem solving skills. Each of the five sections of problems focuses on a key algebraic thinking strategy. Within each section, problems are sequenced by difficulty. For each problem, there is a set of questions to help students focus on important features of the problem in order to solve it.

This module may be used to complement the existing instructional program. It is particularly useful to reinforce concepts of number (counting, quantifying and comparing) and measurement (weight comparisons), as well as to develop problem solving skills.

**The Key Algebraic Concepts**

**Equality/Inequality:** In this module, students explore equal and unequal relationships by interpreting and reasoning about pictures of teeter totters with animals, one at each end of the teeter totter. Their job is to determine which animal is heavier, lighter, or if the two animals weigh the same.

**Proportional Reasoning:** A major reasoning method for solving algebraic problems is by reasoning proportionally. Proportional reasoning is sometimes called “multiplicative reasoning,” because it requires application of multiplication. In this module, students are introduced to proportional relationships when they “fill” bags with shapes to look like a filled bag, and then count to figure out the total number of each type of shape.

**Interpret Representations:** Mathematical relationships can be displayed in a variety of ways including with words, tables, graphs, diagrams and symbols. Having students interpret these types of displays and use the data in the displays to solve problems is critical to success with the study of algebra. In this module, students interpret pan balances, pictographs, drawings of bags of blocks, trains with cars of different colors, and pictures of pumpkins, people and other objects.

**Reason Deductively:** Students compare pictures to clues in order to figure out the one picture that fits all of the clues. They then describe the matching picture. For all problems, three pictures are presented.

**Reason Inductively:** Presented with trains of cars of different colors in repeating patterns, students first identify the colors of the cars and their sequence in the repetition. Second they identify colors of missing cars, either at the end of the train (“What comes next?”) or somewhere before the end of the train (“What color is missing?”). Lastly, students color the cars to complete the pattern. Note that for each pattern, three repeats are given to establish the pattern.

**The Problem Solving Five-Step Model**

The model that we recommend to help students in all grades move through the solution problems has five steps. At the Pre-Kindergarten level, the focus is on **Describe, Solve and Check**.

**Describe** focuses students’ attention on the information in the problem display. In some cases, the display is a diagram. Other times it is a pictograph or model. Having students tell what they see will help them interpret the problem and figure out what to do to solve the problem.

**My Job** helps students focus on the task by having them tell what they have to do, that is, rephrase the problem in their own words.

**Plan** requires identification of the steps to follow to solve the problem and helps students focus on the first step. Knowing where to start is often the most difficult part of the solution process.

**Solve** is putting the plan to work and showing the steps.

**Check** is used to verify the answer.

**We recommend that you “model” these steps in your instruction and that you encourage your students to follow the steps when solving the problems in this module and when relating their solution processes to others.**

### 1.2 Picture Graphs

<article>

**Picture Graphs - Interpret Pictographs**

Given picture graphs showing two or three children’s names along the horizontal axis and pictures of same objects (e.g., balloons, books) stacked above the names, students study the graphs, decide who has more, less, the most, the least, or the same numbers of objects, and then count to tell the number of objects for each child.

All questioning begins with “Tell me what you see,” followed by comparison questions (“More?”, “Less?”, “Most?”, “Least?”, “Same number?”) and identification of the colors of the objects, and then by questions about the numbers of objects.

When counting, urge students to start at the top of a column of objects, and point to each object as it is counted.

On the “Teacher” pages, questions to ask are shown below each graph along with answers. Graphs for the students to use appear on separate pages. Give each child a copy of each graph.

### 1.3 Train Cars

<article>

**Train Cars - Complete Patterns**

**Teacher Notes**

Students use crayons to color (or record letters) train cars, shown as squares, to complete patterns. Before beginning, have students describe what they see, that is name the colors in order. Then have them use crayons to color the train cars to match the letters. In all patterns, B stands for blue, R stands for red, and Y stands for yellow. Car trains always show Pentunia’s face as the train’s engine, the first car, and Ozzie’s face at the end, as the caboose. Once students have finished coloring the empty cars of the train, have them name the colors aloud in order to check that the pattern “sounds right.”

Depending on the pattern, students may be coloring squares near the end of the train to extend the pattern, or coloring squares that are within the pattern. In all patterns, there are three complete repeats of the same group of colors in order to establish the pattern before students have to color the cars.

### 1.4 Teeter-Tottering

<article>

**Teeter Tottering - Balance**

**Teacher Notes**

Presented with a picture of two animals on a teeter totter, students identify the animal that is heavier, lighter or decide if the two animals weigh the same. They describe how they figured it out from the picture of the teeter totter. Teacher questioning uses the following format:

1. Look at the picture.

Tell me what you see.

2. Verify that students are correctly identifying the animals by having them point to the figures after they are named.

3. Present the question:

Who weighs more?/Who is heavier?

Who weighs less?/Who is lighter?

Do they weigh the same?

4. Request a description of the decision making process, “How can you tell from the picture?”

### 1.5 Packing Bags

<article>

**Packing Bags - Proportional Reasoning**

**Teacher Notes**

Given pictures of two, three, or four bags, one of which is filled with circles, squares or triangles, students use their tiles to fill the other bags to look the same. They then identify the total number of tiles of each shape. Patterns for cutting tiles from heavy stock paper are supplied at the end of this activity. If you have shape tiles, students may use those.

For each Packing Bags, problem, always begin by asking students to identify the contents of the “filled” bag, describing or naming the shapes, and counting to determine the number of each.

For your convenience, each packing bags problem is reduced in size and shown along with questions and directions for you to follow to engage students in the activity. The pictures only are available for you to duplicate to give to each student.

### 1.6 Using Clues

<article>

**Using Clues - Deductive Reasoning**

**Teacher Notes**

Students are shown three pictures and clues to identify the character being described.

To conduct this activity, cut out each picture and mount it on cardboard. Place the three pictures in the order indicated by the letters on the bottom left of each picture, A, B, C. After reading the first clue, point to each picture and ask if the picture matches the clue. If it does, leave it in the same position. If it does not match, remove it from view. Read the second clue, and follow the same “matching” procedure. When there is only one picture left, have students tell you about the remaining picture matching the items and number of items as described in the clues.

### 2.1 Introduction

<article>

This algebra module has been designed to introduce kindergarten students to basic concepts of algebra and to enhance their problem solving skills. Each of the six sections of problems focuses on a key algebraic thinking strategy. Within each section, problems are sequenced by difficulty

This module may be used to complement the existing instructional program. It is particularly useful to reinforce concepts of number (counting, quantifying and comparing) and measurement (weight comparisons), as well as to develop problem solving skills.

**The Key Algebraic Concepts**

**Equality/Inequality:** In this module, students explore equal and unequal relationships by interpreting and reasoning about pictures of teeter totters with animals, one at each end of each teeter totter. Their job is to determine which animal is heavier, heaviest, lighter, lightest, or if the animals have the same weight.

**Proportional Reasoning:** A major reasoning method for solving algebraic problems is by reasoning proportionally. Proportional reasoning is sometimes called “multiplicative reasoning,” because it requires application of multiplication. In this module, students are introduced to proportional relationships when they “fill” glasses with straws (2 or 5 straws per glass), and count by 2s or 5s to figure out the total number of straws.

**Interpret Representations:** Mathematical relationships can be displayed in a variety of ways including with words, tables, graphs, diagrams and symbols. Having students interpret these types of displays and use the data in the displays to solve problems is critical to success with the study of algebra. In this module, students interpret pan balances, picture graphs, towers of numbers, letter patterns, and pictures of T-shirts with geometric shapes.

**Reason Deductively:** Students compare pictures to clues in order to figure out the one picture that fits all of the clues. They then describe the matching picture. For all problems, four pictures are presented. Given number towers with some numbers missing, students supply the missing numbers.

**Reason Inductively:** Presented with three rows of letters of a pattern, students identify the pattern and continue it by supplying the next two rows of letters.

**The Problem Solving Five-Step Model**

The model that we recommend to help students in all grades move through the solution problems has five steps. At the Pre-Kindergarten level, the focus is on **Describe, Solve and Check**.

**Describe** focuses students’ attention on the information in the problem display. In some cases, the display is a diagram. Other times it is a pictograph or model. Having students tell what they see will help them interpret the problem and figure out what to do to solve the problem.

**My Job** helps students focus on the task by having them tell what they have to do, that is, rephrase the problem in their own words.

**Plan** requires identification of the steps to follow to solve the problem and helps students focus on the first step. Knowing where to start is often the most difficult part of the solution process.

**Solve** is putting the plan to work and showing the steps.

**Check** is used to verify the answer.

**We recommend that you “model” these steps in your instruction and that you encourage your students to follow the steps when solving the problems in this module and when describing their solution processes to others.**

### 2.3 Straws and Glasses

<article>

**Straws and Glasses - Proportional Reasoning**

Students draw 2 or 5 straws in each glass. They count to tell the number of straws in all. Encourage students to count by 2s or by 5s to figure out the total. Provide crayons or markers for drawing. You may want to do problems 1, 2 and 3,that focus on counting by 2s, as a class exploration. Likewise, 7, 8 and 9, that focus on counting by 5s, may be good to complete as a whole class activity.

### 2.4 Teeter Totter

<article>

**Teeter Totter - Balance**

**Teacher Notes**

Students are given two pictures showing animals on teeter totters. In one picture the two animals are shown in balance (they weigh the same). In the other pictures, animals are shown off balance (they have different weights). Give each child a copy of the pictures A and B. On your copy, keep the set of questions. Answers are in parentheses.

Students answer questions about the perceived weights of the animals, and then determine who weighs the most and the least.

3.  Which picture shows two animals that weigh the same? _(A)_ How can you tell from the picture? _(The balance is not tipped.)_
4.  Which animal weighs more in Picture B? (_Leonard the lion._) How can you tell from the picture? _(The lion side of the teeter totter is lower.)_
5.  Who weighs the most? _(Leonard the lion.)_ How did you decide? _(The squirrel and the bat weigh the same. The lion weighs more than the squirrel, so he also weighs more than the bat. The lion weighs the most.)_

### 2.5 T-Shirt Mystery

<article>

**T-Shirt Mystery - Reason Deductively**

Students use clues to figure out who owns the T-shirt.

All clues are about the number of sides and corners of polygons pictured on T-shirts.

To begin the activity, cut out the four pictures for problem 1, and arrange them face-up, in a row in the order, A, B, C, D. (You may want to back them with cardboard to make them easier to handle.) After you read each, have students identify all pictures that match that clue. If a picture doesn’t match, turn it face down. When only one picture remains, have students describe the shapes on the T-shirt and point to and count the sides and corners of the polygon.

## 3.0 CK-12 Algebra Explorations, Grade 1

<article>



</article>

### 3.1 Introduction

<article>

This algebra module has been designed to introduce grade 1 students to ten key concepts of algebra and to enhance their problem solving skills. Each section begins with a brief description of the problem set and the concepts and skills developed. This is followed by the solutions to problems in the problem set. The first problem in each set is the “teaching problem.” It is completed following the five-step problem solving model and is designed to be used by teachers as the centerpiece of the instructional program. The teaching problem, to be completed by students with the teacher’s guidance, is followed by problems to be completed by the students working on their own or in pairs.

This module may be used as an algebra unit to complement the existing instructional program. It also may be used to show connections between algebra and the strands of number and measurement, to provide practice of number computational algorithms, and to reinforce problem solving skills.

The _Extra for Experts_ provides additional opportunities for students to apply newly learned concepts and skills to the solution of problems like those developed in this Algebra module.

**The Key Algebraic Concepts**

**Equality/Inequality:**

In this module, students explore equal and unequal relationships by interpreting and reasoning about pictures of pan balances. Their job is to figure out which boxes to place in an empty pan to balance the weight in the other pan. This is preparation for the study of variables as unknowns in equations, and reinforcing the concept that there are often multiple solutions to a problem.

**Variables as unknowns:**

Variables may be letters, geometric shapes, or objects that stand for a number of things. When used to represent an _unknown_, the variable has only one value. For example, in the equation, $t + 5 = 7$, the variable $t$ is an unknown and it stands for the number 2. When $t$ is replaced with 2 in the equation, the expression to the left of the equal symbol names the same number as the expression to the right of the equal symbol; $2 + 5$ is another name for 7. In this module, students explore the skill of replacement of variables with their values in order to determine the total weight of collections of various types of blocks, sand solve for unknowns in two-by-two grids representing systems of equations.

**Variables as varying quantities:**

In some equations, variables can take on more than one value. For example, in the equation $q = 2 + r$, if the value of $q$ is 5, then the value of $r$ is 3. Or, if the value of $r$ is 9, the value of $q$ is 11. So, in this case $q$ can be any number. However, once you choose a value for $q$, then the value for $r$ is fixed. Likewise, once you choose a value for $r$, then the value of $q$ is fixed. Variables as varying quantities appear in functions and formulas. In this module, students complete tables of values for one-step (e.g., $y = 2z$) functions, and continue patterns in which elements of the pattern vary based on position.

**Proportional Reasoning:**

A major method for solving algebraic problems is by reasoning proportionally. Proportional reasoning is sometimes called “multiplicative reasoning,” because it requires application of multiplication or its inverse, division. In this module, students reason proportionally when, given the price of one silly sticker, they compute the cost of multiple sets of the stickers.

**Interpret Representations:**

Mathematical relationships can be displayed in a variety of ways including with text, tables, graphs, diagrams and with symbols. Having students interpret these types of displays and use the data in the displays to solve problems is critical to success with the study of algebra. In this module, students interpret pan balances, circle and arrow grid diagrams, tables of values, and weight scales.

**Write Equations:**

Although an equation is a symbolic representation of a mathematical relationship, the writing of an equation is a key algebraic skill and one that requires separate attention and instruction. In this module, students learn to write letter and number equations for the various collections of weights that can balance the pans.

**The Problem Solving Five-Step Model**

The model that we recommend to help students move through the solution problems has five steps:

**Describe** focuses students’ attention on the information in the problem display. In some cases, the display is a diagram. Other times it is a table, graph, equation, or model, or a combination of any of these. Having students tell what they see will help them interpret the problem and identify key facts needed to proceed with the solution method.

**My Job** helps students focus on the task by having them tell what they have to do, that is, rephrase the problem in their own words.

**Plan** requires identification of the steps to follow to solve the problem and helps students focus on the first step. Knowing where to start is often the most difficult part of the solution process.

**Solve** is putting the plan to work and showing the steps.

**Check** is used to verify the answer.

We recommend that you “model” these steps in your instruction with the first problem in each problem set and that you encourage your students to follow the steps when solving the problems and when relating their solution processes to others.

**Note:** Although the instructional pages show only one solution plan, many of the problems have more than one correct solution path. These problems provide excellent opportunities for engaging your students in algebraic conversations about how their solutions are the same, how they differ, and perhaps, which solution method is “most elegant.

### 3.2 Balance the Pans

<article>

**Balance the Pans – Balance-Equality**

**Teacher Notes**

Given a two-pan balance with one pan empty and a weight in the other pan, students determine the boxes that can be placed in the empty pan to balance the pans. Since there are an unlimited number of boxes of each type, there are more than one set of boxes that make the pans balance. In other words, all problems have multiple solutions.

To identify and check the sets of boxes that balance the pans, students will add with more than two addends, all single 0 digit numbers 8 or less. Alternatively, students can count up to find sums. All sums are 18 or less.

**Solutions**

**Balance the Pans 1**

$C+ C = 6 \ pounds$

$D + D + D + D + D + D = 6 \ pounds$

$C + D + D + D = 6 \ pounds$

**Balance the Pans 2**

$F + F + F = 9 \ pounds$

$F + E + E + E = 9 \ pounds$

**Balance the Pans 3**

$G + G + G + G + G = 5 \ pounds$

$H + G + G + G = 5 \ pounds$

$H + H + G = 5 \ pounds$

**Balance the Pans 4**

$J + J + J + J + J = 10 \ pounds$

$I + J + J + J = 10 \ pounds$

$I + I + J = 10 \ pounds$

**Balance the Pans 5**

$K + K + K + K = 12 \ pounds$

$L + L = 12 \ pounds$

$L + K + K = 12 \ pounds$

**Balance the Pans 6**

$M + M + M + M = 16 \ pounds$

$N + N = 16 \ pounds$

$N + M + M = 16 \ pounds$

**(Teacher Page) – You have lots of these boxes.**

### 3.3 How Many Pounds

<article>

**How Many Pounds? – Equation Solving: Replace Variables with Their Values**

**Teacher Notes**

Given the weights of two blocks, students determine the total weight of various collections of these blocks. The key algebraic idea is that of replacement. To figure out the total weight of a collection of blocks, students record the weight of each block on that block (i.e. replacing it with its value), and then add to determine the total weight. These problems prepare students for the skill of substitution which is a major problem solving technique in the solution of algebraic equations.

### 3.4 Circles and Arrows

<article>

**Circles and Arrows – Solve for Unknowns**

In these problems, students are presented two-by-two grids containing circles and arrows. Circles contain numbers or letters that represent unknown quantities. Arrows point to sums of rows and columns. Each row and column represents an equation. For example, a row showing $A$, $A$ and an arrow pointing to 4, can also be represented by the equation: $A + A = 4$. Students use the grid relationships to figure out the values of the letters. There are often several ways to begin to solve each problem. Encourage students to consider and talk about alternative approaches. All sums in the first set of problems are 10 or less. In the Extras for Experts, sums are 18 or less.

**Solutions**

1.  $C = 3, D = 1$
2.  $E = 5, F = 2$
3.  $G = 4, H = 1$
4.  $J =  1, K = 5$
5.  $L = 2, M = 3$
6.  $N = 5, P = 3$
7.  $Q = 2, R = 4$
8.  $S = 4, T = 2$
9.  $U = 4, V = 6$
10. $W = 2, X = 3$

### 3.8 Silly Stickers

<article>

**Silly Stickers – Reason Proportionally**

**Teacher Notes**

Given the price of one sticker, students compute the cost of 2 to 12 stickers. To do the computation, students can either use repeated addition or skip count. Sticker prices are 2, 5 or 10 cents in this set of problems. In the Extras for Experts, individual stickers are 3, 4, or 6 cents

Encourage students to record the cost of a sticker on each of the stickers in each set. This will facilitate the skip counting or use of repeated addition.

### 3.9 Stars and Moons

<article>

**Stars and Moons - Extend Patterns**

**Teaching Notes**

Students identify patterns of stars and moons on three cards and make drawings on the next three cards to continue the pattern. Star patterns may differ from moon patterns. For example, the number of stars may remain constant while the number of moons increases by 1. To facilitate the drawing of stars and moons, suggest that students use an asterisk $(*)$ to represent a star and the capital letter C to represent the moon.

## 4.0 Algebra Explorations, Grade 2

<article>



</article>

### 4.1 Introduction

<article>

This algebra module has been designed to introduce grade 2 students to ten key concepts of algebra and to enhance their problem solving skills. Each section begins with a brief description of the problem set and the concepts and skills developed. This is followed by the solutions to problems in the problem set. The first problem in each set is the “teaching problem.” It is completed following the five-step problem solving model and is designed to be used by teachers as the centerpiece of the instructional program. The teaching problem, to be completed by students with the teacher’s guidance, is followed by problems to be completed by the students working on their own or in pairs.

This module may be used as an algebra unit to complement the existing instructional program. It also may be used to show connections between algebra and the strands of number and measurement, to provide practice of number computational algorithms, and to reinforce problem solving skills.

The _Extra for Experts_ provides additional opportunities for students to apply newly learned concepts and skills to the solution of problems like those developed in this Algebra module.

**The Key Algebraic Concepts**

**Equality/Inequality:**

In this module, students explore equal and unequal relationships by interpreting and reasoning about pictures of pan balances. Their job is to figure out which boxes to place in an empty pan to balance the weight in the other pan. This is preparation for the study of variables as unknowns in equations, and reinforcing the concept that there are often multiple solutions to a problem.

**Variables as unknowns:**

Variables may be letters, geometric shapes, or objects that stand for a number of things. When used to represent an _unknown_, the variable has only one value. For example, in the equation, $t + 5 = 7$, the variable $t$ is an unknown and it stands for the number 2. When $t$ is replaced with 2 in the equation, the expression to the left of the equal symbol names the same number as the expression to the right of the equal symbol; $2 + 5$ is another name for 7. In this module, students solve for the weights of blocks on scales, and for unknowns in two-by-two grids representing systems of equations.

**Variables as varying quantities:**

In some equations, variables can take on more than one value. For example, in the equation $q = 2 + r$, if the value of $q$ is 5, then the value of $r$ is 3. Or, if the value of $r$ is 9, the value of $q$ is 11. So, in this case $q$ can be any number. However, once you choose a value for $q$, then the value for $r$ is fixed. Likewise, once you choose a value for $r$, then the value of $q$ is fixed. Variables as varying quantities appear in functions and formulas. In this module, students complete tables of values for two-step (e.g., _Add 5 and then subtract 2_) functions, and continue patterns in which the elements vary based on their position in the pattern.

**Proportional Reasoning:**

A major method for solving algebraic problems is by reasoning proportionally. Proportional reasoning is sometimes called “multiplicative reasoning,” because it requires application of multiplication or its inverse, division. In this module, students reason proportionally as they trade “critters” as well as compute the unit costs of items in order to determine the better buy.

**Interpret Representations:**

Mathematical relationships can be displayed in a variety of ways including with text, tables, graphs, diagrams and with symbols. Having students interpret these types of displays and use the data in the displays to solve problems is critical to success with the study of algebra. In this module, students interpret pan balances, circle and arrow grid diagrams, tables of values, weight scales and patterns of geometric shapes.

**Write Equations:**

Although an equation is a symbolic representation of a mathematical relationship, the writing of an equation is a key algebraic skill and one that requires separate attention and instruction. In this module, students learn to write letter and number equations for the various collections of weights that can balance the pans.

**The Problem Solving Five-Step Model**

The model that we recommend to help students move through the solution problems has five steps:

**Describe** focuses students’ attention on the information in the problem display. In some cases, the display is a diagram. Other times it is a table, graph, equation, or model, or a combination of any of these. Having students tell what they see will help them interpret the problem and identify key facts needed to proceed with the solution method.

**My Job** helps students focus on the task by having them tell what they have to do, that is, rephrase the problem in their own words.

**Plan** requires identification of the steps to follow to solve the problem and helps students focus on the first step. Knowing where to start is often the most difficult part of the solution process.

**Solve** is putting the plan to work and showing the steps.

**Check** is used to verify the answer.

We recommend that you “model” these steps in your instruction with the first problem in each problem set and that you encourage your students to follow the steps when solving the problems and when relating their solution processes to others.

**Note:** Although the instructional pages show only one solution plan, many of the problems have more than one correct solution path. These problems provide excellent opportunities for engaging your students in algebraic conversations about how their solutions are the same, how they differ, and perhaps, which solution method is “most elegant.

### 4.2 Which Boxes

<article>

**Which Boxes? – Balance-Equality**

**Teacher Notes**

Given a two-pan balance with one pan empty and a weight in the other pan, students determine which boxes from a set of two or three boxes when placed in the empty pan will cause the pans to balance. Since there is an unlimited number of boxes of each type, there is more than one set of boxes that make the pans balance. So, all problems have multiple solutions.

**Solutions**

**Which Boxes? 1**

$H + H + H = 9 \ pounds$

$H + L + L + L = 9 \ pounds$

$G + H + L = 9 \ pounds$

**Which Boxes? 2**

$F + F + F + F + F = 5 \ pounds$

$F + F +  F + E = 5 \ pounds$

$E + E + F = 5 \ pounds$

$E + D = 5 \ pounds$

$D + F + F = 5 \ pounds$

**Which Boxes? 3**

$J + J + J + J + J + J = 12 \ pounds$

$K + K + K + K = 12 \ pounds$

$J + J + J + K + K = 12 \ pounds$

$J + L +  L = 12 \ pounds$

$J + J + K + L = 12 \ pounds$

**Which Boxes? 4**

$R + R + R + R + R = 15 \ pounds$

$R + R + R + S = 15 \ pounds$

$R + S + S = 15 \ pounds$

$R + R + Q = 15 \ pounds$

$Q + S = 15 \ pound$

### 4.3 What's the Weight

<article>

**What’s the Weight? – Solve for Unknowns**

**Teacher Notes**

Given two scales, each holding one, two, or three blocks of two different types, students have to figure out the weights of the individual blocks. They do this by first identifying the scale that holds only one type of block (one unknown) and solving for the weight of that block. Next, students replace that block with its weight on the other scale, and then solve for the weight of the second block.

These problems provide introduction to the solution of systems of two equations with two unknowns. Each scale represents one equation, and can be represented symbolically. For example, a scale that shows two cubes with a total weight of 4 pounds can be displayed as $x + x = 4$.

**Solutions**

**What’s the Weight? 1**

1.  Cube is 5 pounds; sphere is 1 pound
2.  Sphere is 8 pounds; cylinder is 2 pounds

**What’s the Weight? 2**

1.  Triangular prism is 6 pounds; cylinder is 9 pounds
2.  Sphere is 5 pounds; triangular prism is 8 pounds

**What’s the Weight? 3**

1.  Triangular prism is 7 pounds; cube is 2 pounds
2.  Cylinder is 6 pounds; sphere is 1 pound

**What’s the Weight? 4**

1.  Cube is 5 pounds; sphere is 3 pounds

### 4.4 Circles and Arrows

<article>

**Circles and Arrows – Solve for Unknowns**

Circles and Arrows show grids with two rows and three columns. In each grid, circles contain numbers or letters. Letters represent unknown quantities. Arrows point to sums of rows and columns. All rows and columns represent equations. For example, a row that shows $A, A$, 4 and a sum of 10, can be represented as $A + A + 4 = 10$. Students use the grid relationships to figure out the values of the letters. There are often several ways to begin to solve each problem. Encourage students to consider alternative solution approaches and to talk about them.

**Solutions**

1.  $C = 5, D = 4$
2.  $E = 3, D = 8$
3.  $G = 2, H = 5$

### 4.5 Better Buy

<article>

**Better Buy – Proportional Reasoning**

**Teacher Notes**

Given the costs of items at two stores, Mac’s and Zac’s, students determine the unit price, or price for one, and compare the prices. In the first set of problems, one of the stores gives the unit price. The other store gives prices for 2 or 3 of the items.

In the Extras for Experts, two of the four problems, require students to figure out the unit price at both stores.

For all problems, students identify the store with the better buy and describe their solution process. They also compute the cost of multiple items at one of the two stores in the first set of problems, and in the Extras for Experts, they compute the costs of multiple items at both stores.

**Solutions**

**Better Buy 1**

1.  Mac’s
2.  Mac’s: 1 gallon is $4. Zac’s: 1 gallon is half of $10, or $5. $\$4 < \$5$
3.  $\$4 + \$4$, or $8

**Better Buy 2**

1.  Zac’s
2.  Mac’s: 1 bottle is $2. Zac’s: Since 3 bottles cost $3, 1 bottle is $1. $\$1 < \$2$
3.  $\$2 + \$2 + \$2$, or $6

**Better Buy 3**

1.  Mac’s
2.  Mac’s: 1 pound is half of 40 ¢., or 20¢... Zac’s: 1 pound is 30¢. 20¢ < 30¢.
3.  60¢

**Better Buy 4**

1.  Zac’s
2.  Mac’s: 1 plant is $12. Zac’s: Since 3 plants cost $30, 1 plant is $10. $\$10 < \$12$
3.  $\$12 + \$12 + \$12$, or $36

### 4.6 Critter Trades

<article>

**Critter Trades – Proportional Reasoning**

Students reason proportionally as they trade critters (e.g., 1 scorpion for 4 wasps.) All trades are 1 for 2, 3, 4 or 5. As they trade, students record numbers on the traded items, and then skip count or use repeated addition to solve the problems.

In the Extras for Experts, the trading is “backwards,” that is, many to one. For example, if you can get 2 ants for 1 bee, then to get 6 ants, how many bees will you need?

**Solutions**

**Critter Trades 1**

1. 6

2. Write 2 on each spider.

Then, $2 + 2 + 2 = 6$.

**Critter Trades 2**

1. 20

2. Write 5 on each grasshopper

Then, $5 + 5 + 5 + 5  = 20$.

**Critter Trades 3**

1. 15

2. Write 3 on each fly.

Then, $3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15$.

**Critter Trades 4**

1. 40

2. Write 4 on each scorpion.

Then, $4 +  4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40$

**Critter Trades: Centipedes and Moths**

### 4.7 Function Machines

<article>

**Function Machines – Complete two-step function tables**

For these problems, students follow rules presented in words and with symbols to complete two-column function tables. Each of the rules requires two computational steps. Problems 1-12 use addition followed by subtraction. Problems 13 -20 mix the sequence of addition then subtraction and subtraction then addition.

### 4.8 GEO Patterns

<article>

**GEO Patterns – Extend Patterns**

Students identify patterns of circles, triangles and rectangles on three cards, extend the patterns to complete the next two cards in the pattern, and answer questions about the $10^{th}$ card. Shape patterns may differ. For example, the number of circles may remain constant while the number of triangles increases by 1 and the number of rectangles increases by 2. In lieu of drawing the figures, you may want to have students identify the number of shapes of each type on each of the empty cards.

**Solutions**

GEO Pattern 1

1. Card 5: 1 circle, 1 triangle, 5 rectangles

Card 6: 1 circle, 1 triangle, 6 rectangles

2. Card 10: 1 circle, 1 triangle, 10 rectangles

## 5.0 Algebra Explorations, Grade 3

<article>



</article>

### 5.1 Introduction

<article>

This algebra module has been designed to introduce grade 3 students to ten key concepts of algebra and to enhance their problem solving skills. Each section begins with a brief description of the problem set and the concepts and skills developed. This is followed by the solutions to problems in the problem set. The first problem in each set is the “teaching problem.” It is completed following the five-step problem solving model and is designed to be used by teachers as the centerpiece of the instructional program. The teaching problem, to be completed by students with the teacher’s guidance, is followed by problems to be completed by the students working on their own.

This module may be used as an algebra unit to complement the existing instructional program. It also may be used to show connections between algebra and the strands of number and measurement, to provide practice of number computational algorithms, and to reinforce problem solving skills.

The _Extra for Experts_ provides additional opportunities for students to apply newly learned concepts and skills to the solution of problems like those developed in this Algebra module.

**The Key Algebraic Concepts**

**Equality/Inequality:**

In this module, students explore equal and unequal relationships by interpreting and reasoning about pictures of pan balances containing various objects. Their job is to determine which object is heavier, lighter, or which of three objects is the heaviest or lightest. This is preparation for the study of variables as unknowns in equations and as varying quantities in functions.

**Variables as unknowns:**

Variables may be letters, geometric shapes, or objects that stand for a number of things. When used to represent an _unknown_, the variable has only one value. For example, in the equation, $t + 5 = 7$, the variable $t$ is an unknown and it stands for the number 2. When $t$ is replaced with 2 in the equation, the expression to the left of the equal symbol names the same number as the expression to the right of the equal symbol; $2 + 5$ is another name for 7. In this module, students solve for the weights of blocks on scales, and for unknowns in two-by-two grids representing systems of equations.

**Variables as varying quantities:**

In some equations, variables can take on more than one value. For example, in the equation $q = 2 + r$, if the value of $q$ is 5, then the value of $r$ is 3. Or, if the value of $r$ is 9, the value of $q$ is 11. So, in this case $q$ can be any number. However, once you choose a value for $q$, then the value for $r$ is fixed. Likewise, once you choose a value for $r$, then the value of $q$ is fixed. Variables as varying quantities appear in functions and formulas. In this module, students complete tables of values for one-step functions (e.g., $y=2z$) and determine the rule by identifying the relationship between inputs and outputs.

**Proportional Reasoning:**

A major method for solving algebraic problems is by reasoning proportionally. Proportional reasoning is sometimes called “multiplicative reasoning,” because it requires application of multiplication or its inverse, division. In this module, students reason proportionally when they determine better buys (e.g., unit cost or price for one), or interpret pictographs ( e.g., picture of one book stands for 10 books in the graph) to solve comparison problems.

**Interpret Representations:**

Mathematical relationships can be displayed in a variety of ways including with text, tables, graphs, diagrams and with symbols. Having students interpret these types of displays and use the data in the displays to solve problems is critical to success with the study of algebra. In this module, students interpret pan balances, circle and arrow grid diagrams, tables of values, weight scales and weigh equations, better-buy signs, and pictographs.

**Write Equations:**

Although an equation is a symbolic representation of a mathematical relationship, the writing of an equation is a key algebraic skill and one that requires separate attention and instruction. In this module, students learn to write “block equations” for weights of blocks picture on scales. Students explore ways to record multiple copies of the same blocks as both the sum of separate units and as a product. For examples, (Art: square) + (Art: square) + (Art: square) can be represented as 3 (Art: square). They also write rules to represent tables of data related functionally.

**The Problem Solving Five-Step Model**

The model that we recommend to help students move through the solution problems has five steps:

**Describe** focuses students’ attention on the information in the problem display. In some cases, the display is a diagram. Other times it is a table, graph, equation, or model, or a combination of any of these. Having students tell what they see will help them interpret the problem and identify key facts needed to proceed with the solution method.

**My Job** helps students focus on the task by having them tell what they have to do, that is, rephrase the problem in their own words.

**Plan** requires identification of the steps to follow to solve the problem and helps students focus on the first step. Knowing where to start is often the most difficult part of the solution process.

**Solve** is putting the plan to work and showing the steps.

**Check** is used to verify the answer.

We recommend that you “model” these steps in your instruction with the first problem in each problem set and that you encourage your students to follow the steps when solving the problems and when relating their solution processes to others.

**Note:** Although the instructional pages show only one solution plan, many of the problems have more than one correct solution path. These problems provide excellent opportunities for engaging your students in algebraic conversations about how their solutions are the same, how they differ, and perhaps, which solution method is “most elegant.”

### 5.2 Jars and Jars

<article>

**Jars and Jars - Interpret relationships to compare weights**

In each problem, two pan balances are shown with jars of different types. All jars of the same type have the same weight. Students have to figure out the relative weights of objects from the relationships displayed in the pan balances. To begin, be sure that students recognize differences in the types of jars. Draw students’ attention to the position of the pans. If the two pans are not at the same level, then one pan–the lower one is heavier. If the pans are level, then they hold equal weight. One of the difficulties students often experience is recognizing that if one block (call it $A$) has the same weight as, for example, two others, $(B + B)$, then the one block $(A)$ is heavier. Point out to students that $lb$ stands for pounds, and that all jars with the same letter are the same number of pounds.

**Solutions**

1.  $m$ is more than 5 pounds.
2.  $t$ is more than 6 pounds.
3.  $j$ is more than 3 pounds
4.  $z$ is less than 4 pounds
5.  $v$ is more than 3 pounds
6.  $t$ is less than 8 pounds

### 5.4 Circles and Arrows

<article>

**Circles and Arrows - Solve for Unknowns**

Circles and Arrows show grids in which circles contain numbers and letters that represent unknown quantities. Arrows point to sums of rows and columns. For example, in the top row, $3 + A + B = 11$. In the first column, $3 + A + 7 = 12$. Students use the grid relationships to figure out the values of the letters. Although only one approach is shown, there are often several ways to begin to solve each problem. Encourage students to consider alternative approaches for each problem.

**Solutions**

1.  $C = 3; D = 5$
2.  $F =6; G = 8$
3.  $H = 7; J = 9$
4.  $K = 8; L = 5$
5.  $M = 9; N = 7$
6.  $P = 8; Q = 6$

The arrows point to the sum of each row or column. Figure out the value of each letter.

**Write Equations - Write and Solve Equations with Blocks as Unknowns**

Students are presented with two scales, their contents, and their weights, and explore ways to represent relationships shown in the scales by writing block equations. They gain experience matching equations to scale pictures, and then solving sets or systems of equations without the pictures. It is in this section that students are introduced to the idea that sets of the same type of block can be represented as either the sum of that number of blocks (e.g., $n + n + n$) or as a product (e.g., $3 \ n$).

### 5.14 Better Buy: Unit Price

<article>

**Better Buy: Unit Price - Proportional Reasoning**

In **Better Buy: Unit Price**, two signs showing prices for multiple items of the same type at two stores are displayed. Students reason proportionally to first determine the price for one toy (unit price) at each store. Then they compare prices to identify the better buy, that is the item of lesser price. To determine unit price, students divide. All division computations in this section involve basic facts.

**Solutions**

1.  Jim’s Sports; $\$20 \div 4$ or $5 for one paddle and ball ($\$18 \div 3$, or $6 at A-One Athlete).
2.  A-One Athlete; $\$10 \div 5$, or $2 for one Frisbee ($\$6 \div 2$, or $3 at Jim’s Sports).
3.  Jim’s Sports; $\$36 \div 6$, or $6 for one badminton racquet ($\$28 \div 4$, or $7 at A-One Athlete).
4.  A-One Athlete; $\$30 \div 10$, or $3 for one golf ball ($\$24 \div 6$, or $4 at Jim’s Sports).
5.  A-One Athlete; $\$18 \div 9$, or $2 for one birdie ($\$12 \div 4$, or $3 at Jim’s Sports).
6.  Jim’s Sports; $\$15 \div 3$, or $5 for one can of tennis balls ($\$30 \div 5$ or $6 at A-One Athlete).

### 5.16 Better Buy: Buying More than One

<article>

**Better Buy: Buying More than One - Reason Proportionally**

As in the previous section, in **Better Buys: Price for More than One**, students first compute the unit price of an item at two different stores. (Note that students may use other methods.) Then they use that data to compute and compare costs of multiple items from the stores, and determine the savings. An important concept is that to determine the better buy, either the number of items must be the same so that the prices can be compared or the prices must be the same so that the number of items can be compared. This latter concept should be highlighted throughout the grades.

1. $2 less at Morsel’s Market

$6 for 2 gallons of milk at Morsel’s Market (Unit price is $3/gallon)

$8 for 2 gallons of milk at Flynn’s Foods (Unit price is $4/gallon)

2. $3 less at Flynn’s Foods

$15 for 3 bottles of orange juice at Flynn’s Foods (Unit price is $5/bottle)

$18 for 3 bottles of orange juice at Morsel’s Market (Unit price is $6/bottle)

3. $8 less at Flynn’s Foods

$8 for 4 ice cream bars at Flynn’s Foods (Unit price is $2/ice cream bar)

$16 for 4 ice cream bars at Morsel’s Market (Unit price is $4/ice cream bar)

## 6.0 Algebra Explorations, Grade 4

<article>



</article>

### 6.1 Introduction

<article>

This algebra module has been designed to develop grade 4 students understanding of ten key concepts of algebra and to enhance their problem solving skills. Each section begins with a brief description of the problem set and the concepts and skills developed. This is followed by the solutions to problems in the problem set. The first problem in each set is the “teaching problem.” It is completed following the five-step problem solving model and is designed to be used by teachers as the centerpiece of the instructional program. The teaching problem is followed by problems to be completed by the students working on their own.

This module may be used as an algebra unit to complement the existing instructional program. It also may be used to show connections between algebra and the strands of number and measurement, to provide practice of number computational algorithms, and to reinforce problem solving skills.

The _Extra for Experts_ provides additional opportunities for students to apply newly learned concepts and skills to the solution of problems like those developed in this Algebra module.

**The Key Algebraic Concepts**

**Equality/Inequality:**

In this module, students explore equal and unequal relationships by interpreting and reasoning about pictures of pan balances containing various objects. Their job is to determine possible weights of objects. This is preparation for the study of variables as unknowns in equations and as varying quantities in functions.

**Variables as unknowns:**

Variables may be letters, geometric shapes, or objects that stand for a number of things. When used to represent an _unknown_, the variable has only one value. For example, in the equation, $t + 5 = 7$, the variable $t$ is an unknown and it stands for the number 2. When $t$ is replaced with 2 in the equation, the expression to the left of the equal symbol names the same number as the expression to the right of the equal symbol; $2 + 5$ is another name for 7. In this module, students solve for the weights of blocks on scales, and for unknowns in two-by-two grids representing systems of equations.

**Variables as varying quantities:**

In some equations, variables can take on more than one value. For example, in the equation $q = 2 + r$, if the value of $q$ is 5, then the value of $r$ is 3. Or, if the value of $r$ is 9, the value of $q$ is 11. So, in this case $q$ can be any number. However, once you choose a value for $q$, then the value for $r$ is fixed. Likewise, once you choose a value for $r$, then the value of $q$ is fixed. Variables as varying quantities appear in functions and formulas. In this module, students complete tables of values for one-step (e.g., $y = 2z$) as well as two-step functions (e.g., $y = 2z + 1$).

**Proportional Reasoning:**

A major method for solving algebraic problems is by reasoning proportionally. Proportional reasoning is sometimes called “multiplicative reasoning,” because it requires application of multiplication or its inverse, division. In this module, students reason proportionally when they go bargain shopping and determine better buys, or interpret map scales and bar graphs to solve problems.

**Interpret Representations:**

Mathematical relationships can be displayed in a variety of ways including with text, tables, graphs, diagrams and symbols. Having students interpret these types of displays and use the data in the displays to solve problems is critical to success with the study of algebra. In this module, students interpret pan balances, circle and arrow grid diagrams, tables of values, weight scales, better-buy signs, maps, and bar graphs.

**Write Equations:**

Although an equation is a symbolic representation of a mathematical relationship, the writing of an equation is a key algebraic skill and one that requires separate attention and instruction. In this module, students learn to write equations using letters to represent weights of blocks pictured on scales.

**The Problem Solving Five-Step Model**

The model that we recommend to help students move through the solution problems has five steps:

**Describe** focuses students’ attention on the information in the problem display. In some cases, the display is a diagram. Other times it is a table, graph, equation, or model, or a combination of any of these. Having students tell what they see will help them interpret the problem and identify key facts needed to proceed with the solution method.

**My Job** helps students focus on the task by having them tell what they have to do, that is, rephrase the problem in their own words.

**Plan** requires identification of the steps to follow to solve the problem and helps students focus on the first step. Knowing where to start is often the most difficult part of the solution process.

**Solve** is putting the plan to work and showing the steps.

**Check** is used to verify the answer.

We recommend that you “model” these steps in your instruction with the first problem in each problem set and that you encourage your students to follow the steps when solving the problems and when relating their solution processes to others.

**Note:** Although the instructional pages show only one solution plan, many of the problems have more than one correct solution path. These problems provide excellent opportunities for engaging your students in algebraic conversations about how their solutions are the same, how they differ, and perhaps, which solution method is “most elegant.”

### 6.2 Boxes and Boxes

<article>

**Boxes and Boxes - Interpret pan balances to determine values of variables**

**Teacher Notes**

In each problem, two pan balances are shown with boxes of different types. All boxes of the same type have the same weight and all are whole numbers of pounds. Students figure out the relative weights of objects from the relationships displayed by the pan balances. To begin, be sure that students recognize differences in the types of boxes. Draw students’ attention to the positions of the pans. If the two pans are not at the same level, then one pan, the lower one, is heavier. If the pans are level, then they hold equal weight. One of the difficulties students often experience is recognizing that if one box (call it $A$) has the same weight as, for example, two others, ($B + B$), then the one box ($A$) is heavier. Point out to students that $lb$ stands for pounds, and that all boxes with the same letter weigh the same number of pounds.

### 6.4 Circles and Arrows

<article>

**Circles and Arrows - Solve for Unknowns**

**Teacher Notes**

Circles and Arrows show grids in which circles contain numbers and letters that represent unknown quantities. Arrows point to sums of rows and columns. For example, in the top row, $6 + A + B =13$. In the first column, $6 + B + B = 16$. Students use the grid relationships to figure out the values of the letters. Each grid contains three different letters and one number.

**Solutions**

1.  $D = 4, \ E = 1, \ F = 10$
2.  $G = 7, \ H = 3, \ J = 6$
3.  $K = 8, \ M = 4, \ N = 3$
4.  $P = 6, \ R = 2, \ S = 8$

### 6.12 Equations with Letters

<article>

**Equations with Letters - Write and Solve Equations**

**Teacher Notes**

Students are presented with three scales, their contents, and their weights. They represent relationships shown in the scales by writing equations using letters to represent unknown weights of blocks. In the next section, they solve sets or systems of equations without pictures. It is in this section that students represent sets of the same type of block as a product rather than as a sum (e.g., $3n$ _instead of_ $n + n + n$).

**Solutions**

### 6.14 Bargain Shopping

<article>

**Teacher Notes**

In Bargain Shopping signs show prices for the same item at two different stores. At one store, the price is a multiple of the number of units, so the unit price can be easily determined by dividing. At the other store, the price is not a multiple of the number of units. To determine the better buy, students have to equate the number of items from both stores and compare prices.

**Solutions**

## 7.0 Algebra Explorations, Grade 5

<article>



</article>

### 7.1 Introduction

<article>

This algebra module has been designed to develop grade 5 students’ understanding of ten key concepts of algebra and to enhance their problem solving skills. Each section begins with a brief description of the problem set and the concepts and skills developed. This is followed by the solutions to problems in the problem set. The first problem in each set is the “teaching problem.” It is completed following the five-step problem solving model and is designed to be used by teachers as the centerpiece of the instructional program. The teaching problem is followed by problems to be completed by the students working on their own.

This module may be used as an algebra unit to complement the existing instructional program. It also may be used to show connections between algebra and the strands of number and measurement, to provide practice of number computational algorithms, and to reinforce problem solving skills.

The _Extra for Experts_ provides additional opportunities for students to apply newly learned concepts and skills to the solution of problems like those developed in this Algebra module.

**The Key Algebraic Concepts**

**Equality/Inequality:** In this module, students gain greater understanding of equality as they learn about and apply the fundamental order of operations and the distributive property to determine the values of expressions that name the same number. Understanding and using the distributive property is key to working with polynomials in formal courses in algebra.

**Variables as unknowns:** Variables may be letters, geometric shapes, or objects that stand for a number of things. When used to represent an _unknown_, the variable has only one value. For example, in the equation, $t + 5 = 7$, the variable $t$ is an unknown and it stands for the number 2. When $t$ is replaced with 2 in the equation, the expression to the left of the equal symbol names the same number as the expression to the right of the equal symbol; $2 + 5$ is another name for 7. Students solve for the values of unknowns in a variety of settings that model systems of equations.

**Variables as varying quantities:** In some equations, variables can take on more than one value. For example, in the equation $q = 2 + r$, if the value of $q$ is 5, then the value of $r$ is 3. Or, if the value of $r$ is 9, the value of $q$ is 11. So, in this case $q$ can be any number. However, once a value for $q$ is chosen, then the value for $r$ is fixed. Likewise, once a value for $r$ is chosen, then the value of $q$ is fixed. Variables as varying quantities appear in functions and formulas. In this module, students identify and write rules for one-step (e.g., $y = 2z$) functions in words, and apply perimeter and area formulas to solve problems.

**Proportional Reasoning:** A major method for solving algebraic problems is by reasoning proportionally. Proportional reasoning is sometimes called “multiplicative reasoning,” because it requires application of multiplication or its inverse, division. In this module, students reason proportionally when they determine better buys, use coupons for percent discounts, and interpret map scales to solve problems.

**Interpret Representations:** Mathematical relationships can be displayed in a variety of ways including with text, tables, graphs, diagrams and symbols. Having students interpret these types of displays and use the data in the displays to solve problems is critical to success with the study of algebra. In this module, students interpret circle and arrow grid diagrams, weight scales, discount coupons and maps.

**Write Equations:** Although an equation is a symbolic representation of a mathematical relationship, the writing of an equation is a key algebraic skill and one that requires separate attention and instruction. In this module, students learn to write equations using letters to represent weights of blocks pictured on scales.

**The Problem Solving Five-Step Model**

The model that we recommend to help students move through the solution problems has five steps:

**Describe** focuses students’ attention on the information in the problem display. In some cases, the display is a diagram. Other times it is a table, graph, equation, or model, or a combination of any of these. Having students tell what they see will help them interpret the problem and identify key facts needed to proceed with the solution method.

**My Job** helps students focus on the task by having them tell what they have to do, that is, rephrase the problem in their own words.

**Plan** requires identification of the steps to follow to solve the problem and helps students focus on the first step. Knowing where to start is often the most difficult part of the solution process.

**Solve** is putting the plan to work and showing the steps.

**Check** is used to verify the answer.

We recommend that you “model” these steps in your instruction and that you encourage your students to follow the steps when solving the problems in this module and when relating their solution processes to others.

Note: Although the instructional pages show only one solution plan, many of the problems have more than one correct solution path. These problems provide excellent opportunities for engaging your students in algebraic conversations about how their solutions are the same, how they differ, and perhaps, which solution method is “most elegant.”

### 7.2 Solve for the Unknown

<article>

**Solve for the Unknown - Apply Order of Operations**

**Teacher Notes**

Presented with an equation with one unknown, students follow the rule for the order of operations to solve for the value of the unknown. In all equations, unknowns are presented alone as one of the expressions of the equation. All computations are performed on the other expression. The operations to be performed are those in parentheses first, followed, from left to right, by multiplication and division, and then by addition and subtraction.

**Solutions**

1.  $e =18$

### 7.6 Circle Sums

<article>

**Circle Sums - Solve for Values of Unknowns**

**Teacher Notes**

Circle Sums show three-by-three grids of circles that contain either letters that represent unknown quantities or numbers. Arrows point to sums of rows and columns. For example, in Row 1, $A + C + B =14$, and in Column 1, $A + A + B = 17$. Students use grid relationships to figure out the values of the letters. Each grid contains three different letters and one number. Note: There is often more than one solution path.

**Solutions**

1.  $A = 4, \ B = 3, \ C = 5$
2.  $A = 6, \ B = 4, \ C = 8$
3.  $A = 5, \ B = 6, \ C = 3$
4.  $A = 7, \ B = 8, \ C = 6$

The arrows point to the sum of each row or column. Figure out the value of each letter.

### 7.8 Hanging Scales

<article>

**Hanging Scales - Solve for Unknowns**

**Teacher Notes**

Each problem shows three scales, their contents, and their weights. Students use the data provided in the display as clues to determine the weight of each block. All of the scales contain more than one type of block, so weights of blocks cannot be found directly. In all cases, all of the blocks on one of the scales are on a second scale. The second scale contains at least one other block. Students replace the set of blocks with their value in order to find the weight of the other block on the second scale. Once the value of one block is known, urge students to record its value on all blocks of that type on all scales. This will enable students to figure out the weights of the other blocks. Encourage students to check solutions by replacing each block with its weight and comparing the total weight with the scale indicator.

### 7.10 XYZ

<article>

**XYZ - Solve Systems of Equations**

**Teacher Notes**

Students are presented with three equations with three unknowns. All equations have more than one variable. In all cases, all variables in one equation are in a second equation. The second equation contains at least one other variable. Students learn to replace the set of variables with its value in order to find the value of the other variable in the second equation. Once the value of one variable is known, its value can be used to figure out the values of the other variables. Encourage students to check solutions by replacing variables with their values.

**Solutions**

1.  $x = 4, \ y = 7, \ z = 6$
2.  $x = 6, \ y = 8, \ z = 9$
3.  $x = 3, \ y = 6, \ z = 5$
4.  $x = 5, \ y = 4, \ z = 7$
5.  $x = 9, \ y = 5, \ z = 8$
6.  $x = 8, \ y = 10, \ z = 7$
7.  $x = 12, \ y = 9, \ z = 11$

**Rectangle Facts - Apply formulas**

**Teacher Notes**

Each problem gives facts about the relationship between the length and the width of a rectangle, and its perimeter. Students use facts and the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to determine the dimensions of the rectangle. Once the dimensions of the rectangle are determined, students figure out the area of the rectangle.

**Solutions**

1.  Length 10 inches, Width 2 inches, Area 20 square inches
2.  Length 8 inches, Width 5 inches, Area 40 square inches
3.  Length 9 inches, Width 5 inches, Area 45 square inches
4.  Length 8 inches, Width 3 inches, Area 24 square inches
5.  Length 12 inches, Width 4 inches, Area 48 square inches

**Growing Patterns - Patterns and Functions**

**Teacher Notes**

Growing Patterns require students to analyze the first 3 or 4 figures of a pattern, identify relationships between the pattern number and the number of items, describe the $10^{th}$ figure, and write the rule that relates the pattern number and the number of items. Encourage students to make a table to organize their data. The table will help them to observe the relationship and write the rule.

**Smart Shopping - Reason Proportionally Using Least Common Multiples**

**Teacher Notes**

Smart Shopping shows prices for the same item from two different stores. To determine the better buy, students equate the number of items in order to compare prices. To accomplish this, they 1) identify the least common multiple of number of items, 2) the prices for those numbers of items, and 3) and compare prices to determine the better buy.

### 7.18 Save More

<article>

**Save More - Reason Proportionally with Percents**

**Teacher Notes**

Students are presented with prices of sets of items at two different stores, and a coupon that can be applied to the purchase at both stores. To determine the better buy, students first reason proportionally to figure out the costs of the items at each store. Then, they apply the coupon in order to determine the discounted cost, and compare those costs to figure out the savings.

To determine the total cost after applying the coupon, students may use either a one- or two-step process. On the teaching page, we use the one-step process in the Solve step and the two-step process in the Check step. For example, if an item is discounted 10%, then its new price is 90% of the original price. So, multiplying the original price by 0.9 will give the discounted price using one computational step. For the two-step method, the discount is taken first (10% of the original price is the discount). For the second step, the amount of the discount is subtracted from the original price to get the discounted price.

**Solutions**

$$
1. \quad \text{Gem's;} \ \$.90 \ \text{less}\!\\ 
{\;} \quad \ \text{ABC's:} \ 1 \ \text{comb is} \ \$15 \div 5, \ \text{or} \ \$3\!\\

{\;} \quad \ \text{Gem's:} \ 1 \ \text{comb is} \ \$12 \div 6, \ \text{or} \ \$2\!\\
{\;} \quad \ \text{With the coupon the cost is} \ 0.9 \times \$2, \ \text{or} \ \$1.80\!\\  
{\;} \quad \ \$2.70 - \$1.80 = \$0.90

## 8.0 Algebra Explorations, Grade 6

<article>



</article>

### 8.1 Introduction

<article>

This algebra module has been designed to develop grade 6 students’ understanding of ten key algebraic concepts and to enhance their problem solving skills. Each section begins with a brief description of the problem set and of the concepts and skills that will be developed. This is followed by the solutions to the problems in the problem set. The first problem in each set is the “teaching problem.” It is completed following the five-step problem solving model and is designed to be used by teachers as the centerpiece of the instructional program. The teaching problem is followed by problems that are to be completed by students working on their own.

This module may be used as an algebra unit to complement the existing instructional program. It also may be used to show connections between algebra, strands of number, and measurement, to provide practice of number computational algorithms, and to reinforce problem solving skills.

The _Extra for Experts_ problem sets provide additional opportunities for students to apply newly learned concepts and skills toward solving problems similar to those developed in this algebra module.

**The Key Algebraic Concepts**

**Equality/Inequality:** In this module, students gain greater understanding of equality as they learn about and apply the fundamental order of operations, which include exponentiations and the distributive property, to determine the values of expressions that name the same number. Understanding and using the distributive property is the key to working with polynomials in formal courses in algebra.

**Variables as Unknowns:** Variables may be letters, geometric shapes, or objects that stand for a number of things. When used to represent an _unknown_, the variable has only one value. For example, in the equation, $t + 5 = 7$, the variable $t$ is an unknown and it stands for the number 2. When $t$ is replaced with 2 in the equation, the expression to the left of the equal symbol names the same number as the expression to the right of the equal symbol; $2 + 5$ is another name for 7. Students solve for the values of unknowns in a variety of settings that model systems of equations, including letter grids and hanging scales.

**Variables as Varying Quantities:** In some equations, variables can take on more than one value. For example, in the equation $q = 2 + r$, if the value of $q$ is 5, then the value of $r$ is 3. Or, if the value of $r$ is 9, the value of $q$ is 11. So, in this case $q$ can be any number. However, once a value for $q$ is chosen, then the value for $r$ is fixed. Likewise, once a value for $r$ is chosen, then the value of $q$ is fixed. Variables as varying quantities appear in functions and formulas. In this module, students identify and write rules for two-step (e.g., $y = 2z + 4$) functions in words, and apply perimeter and area formula to solve problems.

**Proportional Reasoning:** A major method for solving algebraic problems is by reasoning proportionally. Proportional reasoning is sometimes called “multiplicative reasoning,” because it requires application of multiplication or its inverse, division. In this module, students reason proportionally when they determine weights of coins in grams.

**Interpret Representations:** Mathematical relationships can be displayed in a variety of ways including with text, tables, graphs, diagrams and symbols. Having students interpret these types of displays and use the data in the displays to solve problems is critical to success with the study of algebra. In this module, students interpret circle and arrow grid diagrams, weight scales, and line graphs.

**Write Equations:** Although an equation is a symbolic representation of a mathematical relationship, the writing of an equation is a key algebraic skill that requires separate attention and instruction. In this module, students write systems of equations using letters to represent weights of blocks pictured on scales, purchases of items, number of shapes in patterns, and distance/time relationships.

**The Problem Solving Five-Step Model**

The model that we recommend to help students move through the problem solving process has five steps:

**Describe** focuses students’ attention on the information in the problem display. In some cases, the display is a diagram. Other times it is a table, graph, equation, model, or a combination of any of these. Having students tell what they see will help them interpret the problem and identify key facts needed to proceed with the solution method.

**My Job** helps students focus on the task by having them explain what they have to do; that is, rephrase the problem in their own words.

**Plan** requires identification of the steps needed to solve the problem and helps students focus on the first step. Knowing where to start is often the most difficult part of the solution process.

**Solve** is putting the plan to work and showing the steps.

**Check** is used to verify the answer.

We recommend that you “model” these steps in your instruction and that you encourage your students to follow the steps when solving the problems in this module and when relating their solution processes to others.

Note: Although the instructional pages show only one solution plan, many of the problems have more than one correct solution path. These problems provide excellent opportunities for engaging your students in algebraic conversations about how their solutions are the same, how they differ, and perhaps, which solution method is “most elegant.”

### 8.2 What’s the Value

<article>

**What’s the Value? – Solve for Unknowns**

**Teacher Notes**

To solve for values of unknowns in equations, students perform all computations following the order of operations: operations in parentheses first, followed by exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and then addition and subtraction from left to right. Operations within parentheses follow the standard order, as well. Encourage students to replace the variable with its value and check to be sure that the two expressions (to the left and to the right of the = symbol) name the same number.

**Solutions:**

$$
1. \ \quad b + 2 \times 3 \times 2^2 \div 3 = 2(5 + 6) - 2\!\\

{\;} \qquad 4 \times 4 + h + 9 - 8 + 4 = 9 \times 3 - 2 \times 3\!\\
{\;} \qquad 16 + h + 9 - 8 + 4 = 27 - 6\!\\

### 8.3 Solve for Unknowns

<article>

**Solve for Unknowns – Apply the Distributive Property**

**Teacher Notes**

To solve for values of unknowns in equations, students perform all computations following the order of operations: operations in parentheses first, followed by exponentiation, multiplication and division left to right, then addition and subtraction left to right. When the variable is in parentheses, students must apply the distributive property of multiplication over addition: $a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$. Encourage students to check by replacing the variable in the equation with its value, perform the computations, and verify that the two expressions (to the left and to the right of the = symbol) name the same number.

**Solutions:**

$$
1. \quad \ (3 + 5)^2 \div 2 - 2 = 2b + 4^2\!\\

### 8.4 Circle Sums

<article>

**Circle Sums – Solve for Values of Unknowns**

**Teacher Notes**

Circle Sums show grids in which circles contain letters that represent unknowns. Arrows point to sums of rows and columns. For example, in Row 1, $A + B + C + C = 19$, and in Column 1, $A + B + C = 14$. Students use the grid relationships to figure out the values of the letters. Each grid contains four different letters.

**Solutions:**

1.  $A = 4, \ B = 5, \ C = 8, \ D = 7$
2.  $A = 6, \ B= 7, \ C = 4, \ D = 9$
3.  $A = 7, \ B= 8, \ C = 3, \ D = 6$
4.  $A = 5, \ B = 9, \ C = 7, \ D = 8$

### 8.5 Hanging Scales

<article>

**Hanging Scales – Write Equations and Solve for Unknowns**

**Teacher Notes**

Each problem shows three scales, their contents, and their weights. Students use the data provided in the display as clues to determine the weight of each block. All of the scales contain more than one type of block, so weights of blocks cannot be found directly. In all cases, one of the scales has a double set of two blocks. Students figure out the value of a single set of these two blocks. A second scale contains a single set of the same two blocks and one other block. Students must replace the set of blocks with their value in order to find the weight of the other block on the second scale. Once the value of one block is determined, urge students to record its value on all blocks of that type on all scales. This will enable students to figure out the weights of the remaining blocks. Encourage students to check solutions by replacing each block with its weight and comparing the total weight with the scale indicator.

**Solutions:**

$$
1. \quad A: x + z + x + z = 20; \ B: x + y + z = 15; \ C: x + y + y = 14\!\\
{\;} \ \quad x = 4, \ y = 5, \ z = 6\!\\

### 8.6 Equal Costs

<article>

**Equal Costs – Write and Solve Equations for Equal Cost Problems**

**Teacher Notes**

In Equal Costs, students are given information about the purchases of two people who spend the same amount of money for groups of items. In each group some items are the same. Students write an expression for the purchases for each person, and set the expressions equal to one another to represent the equal costs. Students then solve the equation for the value of the unknown. This is the first problem set in which students encounter equations with unknowns and constants on both sides of the equal sign. They add or subtract equal amounts from each side of the equation to figure out the value of the unknown.

**Solutions:**

1.  $2b = b + 4; 2b - b = b + 4 - b; b = 4$; one sandwich costs $4.
2.  $4c + 2 = 3c + 5; 4c + 2 - 3c = 3c + 5 - 3c; c + 2 = 5; c + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2; c = 3;$ one small soda costs $3.
3.  $6d = 4d + 3; 6d - 4d = 4d + 3 - 4d; 2d = 3; d = 1.5$; one muffin costs $1.50.
4.  $5f + 5 = 3f + 29; 5f + 5 - 3f = 3f + 29 - 3f; 2f + 5 = 29; 2f + 5 - 5 = 29 - 5; 2f = 24; f = 12;$ one CD costs $12.
5.  $4g + 2 = 2g + 4 + 3 + 5; 4g + 2 = 2g + 12; 4g + 2 - 2g = 2g + 12 - 2g; 2g + 2 = 12; 2g + 2 - 2 = 12 - 2; 2g = 10; g = 5;$ one movie ticket costs $5.
6.  $10j = 5j + 10; 10j - 5j = 5j + 10 - 5j; 5j = 10; j = 2$; one pound of apples costs $2.

### 8.7 Rectangle Facts

<article>

**Rectangle Facts – Apply Measurement Formulas**

**Teacher Notes**

Each problem shows a rectangle separated into four smaller rectangles. The areas for three of the four rectangles are given. Students use the data provided and the formula for the area of a rectangle to figure out the dimensions of each of the three rectangles. Once they have found the dimensions of the three rectangles, they can figure out the dimensions of the fourth rectangle and determine its area.

**Solutions:**

1.  20 square inches
2.  32 square inches
3.  32 square inches
4.  6 square inches
5.  56 square inches
6.  8 square inches

### 8.8 Two-Step Patterns

<article>

**Two Step Patterns – Identify Patterns and Write Function Rules**

**Teacher Notes**

Two Step Patterns require students to analyze the first 3 or 4 figures of a pattern, identify relationships between the pattern number and the number of items needed to draw the figure, describe the $10^{\text{th}}$ figure, and write the rule (in symbols) that relates the pattern number and the number of items. All rules require two steps: multiplication and either addition or subtraction. Encourage students to make a table to organize their data. The table will help them to observe the relationship and write the rule.

### 8.9 Coin Stumpers

<article>

**Coin Stumpers – Reason Proportionally with Metric Measurements**

**Teacher Notes**

Students reason proportionally about weights of coins in grams. They use those weights to solve multi-step problems. All weights are given to the nearest tenth of a gram.

The _Extra for Experts_ include the values of the coins as an additional factor to consider in the problem solutions.

**Solutions:**

**Coin Stumpers 1**

2.3 grams

50 nickels are $50 \times 5$ grams, or 250 grams; $273 - 250 = 23$ grams for 10 dimes. One dime is $\frac{23}{10}$, or 2.3 grams.

**Coin Stumpers 2**

80 pennies

20 nickels are $20 \times 5$ grams or 100 grams. $300 - 100 = 200$ grams.

$\frac{200}{2.5} = 80$ pennies.

**Coin Stumpers 3**

20 pennies and 40 dimes

50 grams is $\frac{50}{2.5}$, or 20 pennies. $142 - 50 = 92$ grams.

$\frac{92}{2.3} = 40$ dimes

**Coin Stumpers 4**

20 nickels

20 pennies are $20 \times 2.5$ grams $= 50$ grams; 18 dimes are $18 \times 2.3$ grams $= 41.4$ grams. $191.4 - 91.4 = 100$ grams.

$\frac{100}{5} = 20$ nickels.

**Coin Stumpers – Reason Proportionally with Metric Measurements**

**A pile of 100 pennies weighs 250 grams.**

**A nickel weighs twice as much as a penny.**

**What is the weight of a pile of 300 coins, half pennies and half nickels?**

**Solutions:**

**Coin Stumpers Extra 1**

$2.20

20 dimes is $20 \times 2.3$ grams, or 46 grams

$96 - 46 = 50$ grams

$\frac{50}{2.5} = 20$ pennies

20 dimes is $2.00

20 pennies is $0.20

$\$2 + \$0.20 = \$2.20$

**Coin Stumpers Extra 2**

200 pennies

$\$25 \times 20$ nickels/dollar $= 500$ nickels

$500 \times 5$ grams $= 2500$ grams of nickels

$3000 - 2500 = 500$ grams of pennies

$\frac{500}{2.5} = 200$ pennies

**Coin Stumpers Extra 3**

$.25

30 pennies is $30 \times 2.5$, or 75 grams.

20 dimes is $20 \times 2.3$, or 46 grams.

$146 - 75 - 46 = 25$ grams of nickels

$\frac{25}{5} = 5$ nickels

5 nickels are $.25

**Coin Stumpers Extra 4**

$2.50

15 pennies is $15 \times 2.5$, or 37.5 grams.

27 nickels is $27 \times 5$, or 135 grams.

$195 - 27.5 - 135 = 23$ grams for dimes.

**Trip Functions – Complete Tables and Write Function Rules**

**Teacher Notes**

Students use facts to complete rate tables and write rules in words to describe the relationship between the input and the output. All functions are of the form of $y = a \cdot x + b$, that is, the sum of an initial value (number of miles showing on odometers/pedometers before the start of a trip) and the product of number of hours traveled and average speed in miles per hour.

### 8.11 Drive Away

**Drive Away – Interpret Graphs and Write Functions Rules**

**Teacher Notes**

Each distance-time graph shows two lines representing the speeds of two drivers. Students first interpret the Fact to identify the driver of interest. Next they complete a Time-Distance table of values for the first 6 hours travelled. By inspecting the table of values and identifying relationships between entries in each line of the table, they write a rule that shows how the Distance $(D)$, or number of miles traveled, relates to the amount of time $(t)$, or number of hours of travel.

## 9.0 Algebra Explorations, Grade 7

<article>



</article>

### 9.1 Introduction

<article>

This algebra module has been designed to develop grade 7 students’ understanding of ten key concepts of algebra and to enhance their problem solving skills. Each section begins with a brief description of the problem set and the concepts and skills developed. This is followed by the solutions to problems in the problem set. The first problem in each set is the “teaching problem.” It is completed following the five-step problem solving model and is designed to be used by teachers as the centerpiece of the instructional program. The teaching problem is followed by problems to be completed by the students working on their own.

This module may be used as an algebra unit to complement the existing instructional program. It also may be used to show connections between algebra and the strands of number and measurement, to provide practice of number computational algorithms, and to reinforce problem solving skills.

The _Extra for Experts_ provides additional opportunities for students to apply newly learned concepts and skills to the solution of problems like those developed in this Algebra module.

**The Key Algebraic Concepts**

**Equality/Inequality**: In this module, students gain greater understanding of equality as they learn about and apply the fundamental order of operations, including exponentiations and the distributive property, to determine the values of expressions that name the same number. Understanding and using the distributive property is key to working with polynomials in formal courses in algebra.

**Variables as unknowns**: Variables may be letters, geometric shapes, or objects that stand for a number of things. When used to represent an _unknown_, the variable has only one value. For example, in the equation, $t + 5 = 7$, the variable $t$ is an unknown and it stands for the number 2. When $t$ is replaced with 2 in the equation, the expression to the left of the equal symbol names the same number as the expression to the right of the equal symbol; $2 + 5$ is another name for 7. Students solve for the values of unknowns in a variety of settings that model systems of equations, including letter grids and hanging scales.

**Variables as varying quantities**: In some equations, variables can take on more than one value. For example, in the equation $q = 2 + r$, if the value of $q$ is 5, then the value of $r$ is 3. Or, if the value of $r$ is 9, the value of $q$ is 11. So, in this case $q$ can be any number. However, once a value for $q$ is chosen, then the value for $r$ is fixed. Likewise, once a value for $r$ is chosen, then the value of $q$ is fixed. Variables as varying quantities appear in functions and formulas. In this module, students identify and write rules for two-step (e.g., $y = 2z + 4$) functions in words, and apply the distance-rate-time formula to solve problems.

**Proportional Reasoning**: A major method for solving algebraic problems is by reasoning proportionally. Proportional reasoning is sometimes called “multiplicative reasoning,” because it requires application of multiplication or its inverse, division. In this module, students reason proportionally when they determine weights or costs of different types of fruits, when they apply the $D=rt$ formula, and when they determine the nature of positions of numbers in a repeating pattern.

**Interpret Representations**: Mathematical relationships can be displayed in a variety of ways including with text, tables, graphs, diagrams and symbols. Having students interpret these types of displays and use the data in the displays to solve problems is critical to success with the study of algebra. In this module, students interpret circle and arrow grid diagrams, weight scales, and line graphs and tables of data.

**Write Equations:** Although an equation is a symbolic representation of a mathematical relationship, the writing of an equation is a key algebraic skill and one that requires separate attention and instruction. In this module, students write systems of equations using letters to represent weights of blocks pictured on scales, relationships between pairs of data in tables, and relationships among distance, rate and time.

**The Problem Solving Five-Step Model**

The model that we recommend to help students move through the solution problems has five steps:

**Describe** focuses students’ attention on the information in the problem display. In some cases, the display is a diagram. Other times it is a table, graph, equation, or model, or a combination of any of these. Having students tell what they see will help them interpret the problem and identify key facts needed to proceed with the solution method.

**My Job** helps students focus on the task by having them tell what they have to do, that is, rephrase the problem in their own words.

**Plan** requires identification of the steps to follow to solve the problem and helps students focus on the first step. Knowing where to start is often the most difficult part of the solution process.

**Solve** is putting the plan to work and showing the steps.

**Check** is used to verify the answer.

We recommend that you “model” these steps in your instruction and that you encourage your students to follow the steps when solving the problems in this module and when relating their solution processes to others.

Note: Although the instructional pages show only one solution plan, many of the problems have more than one correct solution path. These problems provide excellent opportunities for engaging your students in algebraic conversations about how their solutions are the same, how they differ, and perhaps, which solution method is “most elegant.”

### 9.2 X the Unknown

<article>

**$X$ The Unknown – Solve for Unknowns using the Distributive Property**

**Teacher Notes**

Students apply the distributive property and the rule for order of operations to solve equations involving unknowns. In all problems, students have to find square roots of values. All roots are the positive roots of square numbers. Be sure that students show all computational steps.

**Solutions:**

**$\textbf{\textit{X}}$ The Unknown 1**

$$
x^2 + 4(3 + x) - 3 = 2(2x + 9)\\
x^2 + 12 + 4x - 3 = 4x + 18\\
x^2 + 12 - 3 - 4x = 4x - 4x + 18\\
x^2 + 12 - 3 = 18\\
x^2 + 9 = 18\\
x^2 + 9 - 9 = 18 - 9\\
x^2 = 9\\
x=3
$$

**$\textbf{\textit{X}}$ The Unknown 2**

$$
4(3 - x) + 9^2 = x(x - 4) + 7^2 - 5\\
12 - 4x + 9^2 = x^2 - 4x + 7^2 - 5\\
12 - 4x + 81 = x^2 - 4x + 49 - 5\\
93 - 4x = x^2 - 4x + 44\\
93 - 4x + 4x = x^2 - 4x + 44 + 4\\
93 = x^2 + 44\\
93 - 44 = x^2 + 44 - 44\\
49 = x^2\\
7 = x
$$

**$\textbf{\textit{X}}$ The Unknown 3**

$$
5(x + 8) + 8^2 - (5^2 + 3 \times 13) = x(x+5) + (9-7)^2\\
5x + 40 + 8^2 - (5^2 + 3 \times 13) = x^2 + 5x + (9-7)^2\\
5x + 40 + 8^2 - (25 + 3 \times 13) = x^2 + 5x + 2^2\\
5x + 40 + 64 - (25 + 39) = x^2 + 5x + 4\\
5x + 40 + 64 - 64 = x^2 + 5x + 4\\
5x + 40 = x^2 + 5x + 4\\
5x + 40 - 5x = x^2 + 5x + 4 - 5x\\
40 = x^2 + 4\\
40 - 4 = x^2 + 4 - 4\\
36 = x^2\\
6 = x

### 9.3 Letter Grids 1-4

<article>

**Letter Grids – Solve for Unknowns**

**Teacher Notes**

Letter grids show three rows and four columns of circles, each containing a number or letter. Letters represent unknown values. Same letters have same values. Arrows point to sums of rows and columns. Students use relationships among contents of row and columns to figure out the values of the five unknowns. For each grid, one of the columns is a subset of one of the rows. For example, in the teaching example, Column 4 contains $A, B,$ and $C$. Row 3 also contains $A$, $B$ and $C$, as well as an additional $C$. The $ABC$ in Row 3 can be replaced with its sum (18), and the value of the remaining $C$ can be determined.

Encourage students to record the value of a variable everywhere it appears in the grid, once it has been determined. This will facilitate the solution process by helping students see rows and columns where only one variable remains.

Note: For some problems, there are different solution paths.

**Solutions:**

$$
\mathbf{Letter \ Grid \ 1 :}  \ M = 13, \ P = 10, \ Q = 20, \ T = 6, \ W=2\!\\

### 9.6 Hanging Scales

<article>

**Hanging Scales – Solve for Unknowns**

**Teacher Notes**

Each problem shows four scales, their contents, and their weights. Students use the data provided in the display as clues to write equations and determine the weight of each block. All scales contain more than one type of block, so weights of blocks cannot be found directly. In some cases, one scale has two sets of the same two blocks and another scale contains that set of blocks and a different block. Students figure out the value of one set of blocks, replace the set of blocks on the other scale with its value, and then determine the weight of the remaining block(s) on the scale.

In other cases, all blocks on one scale are a subset of blocks on a second scale. Students replace the set of blocks with its value in order to find the weight of the other block or blocks on the second scale.

Once the value of one block is determined, urge students to record its value on all blocks of that type on all scales. This will enable students to figure out the weights of the remaining blocks. Encourage students to check solutions by replacing each block with its weight and comparing the total weight with the scale indicator.

**Solutions**

### 9.8 Speedo

<article>

**Speedo – Use Formulas**

**Teacher Notes**

Students apply the $\text{distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} \ (D = rt)$ formula to the solution of problems involving average speeds. For some problems, students will convert feet to miles $(1 \ mile = 5280 \ feet)$ and seconds to minutes to hours. Encourage students to use calculators for the “messy” calculations.

**Solutions**

**Speedo 1**

$$
D = rt\\
D = 264 \ ft/sec \times 0.5 \ sec\\
D = 132 \ ft
$$

**Speedo 2**

$$
D = rt\\
5000 \ ft = 200 \ ft/sec \times t\\
\frac{5000 \ ft}{200 \ ft/sec} = t\\
25 \ seconds = t
$$

**Speedo 3**

$$
D = rt\\
\frac{1}{2} \ mile = \frac{5280}{2}, \ \text{or} \ 2640 \ ft\\
2640 = 37.9 \ ft/sec \times t\\
\frac{2640}{37.9} = t\\
69.7 \ sec = t\\
t \ \text{is about} \ 1 \ \text{minute}.
$$

**The average speed of the winner in the 30-minute bicycle race was 52 feet per second. To the nearest tenth of a mile, how many miles was the race?**

### 9.11 Fruit Confusion

<article>

**Fruit Confusion – Reason Proportionally**

**Teacher Notes**

In each problem, students are presented with a box of fruit labeled with it weight or cost, and a sign giving the cost for one or more pounds of the fruit or the cost of two or more pieces of the fruit. The pieces of fruit are of the same type (eg., all bananas) and are countable. Students use a proportion to figure out the average weight or cost of one piece of fruit. Students may use calculators for the computations.

**Solutions**

1.  $\$0.14; \frac{\$ 0.69}{1\ pound} = \frac{x \ dollars}{1.2\ pounds}$, so $x$ is about $0.83. One orange is $\$0.83 \div 6$ or about $0.14.
2.  $\$3.60; \frac{9 \ pounds}{x \ dollars} = \frac{4 \ avocados}{\$ 2.40}$, so $x = \$5.40$, the cost of 1.5 pounds. The cost of one pound is $\$5.40 \div 1.5$, or $3.60.
3.  0.7 pounds; $\frac{2\ pounds}{\$ 1.00} = \frac{x \ pounds}{\$ 2.10}$, so $x = 4.2$ pounds. One grapefruit weighs $4.2 \div 6$, or about 0.7 pounds.
4.  $\$0.05; \frac{3\ pounds}{\$ 1.20} = \frac{1.5\ pounds}{x \ dollars}$, so $x = \$0.60$, and $\$0.60 \div 12 = \$0.05$.

![0](media/858.png "Figure 1: $$")
\begin{align*}
& \mathbf{Describe:} && \text{There are}\ 8\ \text{bananas in a box weighing a total of}\ 3.2\ \text{pounds. A sign shows that}\\
& && 4\ \text{pounds of bananas cost}\ \$2.00. \\
\\
& \mathbf{My \ Job:} && \text{Figure out the cost of one banana. Assume bananas weigh the same.} \\
\\
& \mathbf{Plan:} && \text{Use a proportion to figure out the cost of}\ 3.2\ \text{pounds of bananas}. \\ 
& && \text{Then divide that cost by 8 to get the cost of one banana}. \\
\\
& \mathbf{Solve:} && \frac{4\ pounds}{\$ 2.00} = \frac{3.2\ pounds}{x \ dollars}; 4x = \$2.00 \times 3.2.\ \text{So},\ 4x = \$6.40,\ \text{and}\ \$6.40 \div 4 =  \$1.60. \\
& && \text{One banana costs}\ \$1.60 \div 8,\ \text{or}\ \$0.20. \\
\\
& \mathbf{Check:} && \text{One banana weighs}\ 3.2 \div 8,\ \text{or}\ 0.4\ \text{pounds and costs}\ \$0.20. \\
& && 10\ \text{bananas} \times 0.4\ \text{pounds/banana} = 4\ \text{pounds}. \\
& && 10\ \text{bananas} \times \$0.20/\text{banana} = \$2.00

### 9.13 Yummy Yogurt and Yummy Yogurt Extra for Experts

<article>

**Yummy Yogurt – Write Function Rules**

**Notes to Teachers**

Students use facts on signs to complete tables of related data. They use variables to write rules that relate Number of Scoops to Total Cost. All functions are of the form $y = n(a) + b$. In that function, $\textbf{\textit{y}}$ represents the total cost of a cone of yogurt. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cone or some other fixed item $\textbf{(\textit{b})}$ and the product of the number of scoops $(n)$, which varies, and the cost of one scoop $\textbf{(\textit{a})}$.

**Solutions**
